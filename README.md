This library provides simple access to data structures (binary packing
and JSON interface) and API calls to an EOS.IO RPC server, running
remotely or locally.  It provides wallet functionalities (KeyBag), or
can sign transaction through the `keosd` wallet. It also knows about
the P2P protocol on port 9876.

As of before the June launch, this library is pretty much in
flux. Don't expect stability, as we're moving alongside the main
`eosio` codebase, which changes very fast.

This library is the basis for the `eos-bios` launch orchestrator tool
at https://github.com/snakewarhead/eos-bios


Basic usage
-----------

```go
api := eos.New("http://testnet1.eos.io")

infoResp, _ := api.GetInfo()
accountResp, _ := api.GetAccount("initn")
fmt.Println("Permission for initn:", accountResp.Permissions[0].RequiredAuth.Keys)
```

`eosio.system` and `eosio.token` contract _Actions_ are respectively in:
* https://github.com/snakewarhead/eos-go/tree/master/system ([godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/snakewarhead/eos-go/system))
* https://github.com/snakewarhead/eos-go/tree/master/token ([godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/snakewarhead/eos-go/token))
